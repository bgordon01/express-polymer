# Express-polymer [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bgordon01/express-polymer.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/bgordon01/express-polymer)
> Express JS Framework & Polymer Web Components Scaffolding 

Javascript Framework | Homepage | Version
-------------------- | -------- | -------
![express](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bgordon01/express-polymer/develop/expressLogo.png) | http://www.expressjs.com | version 4.13.3

![polymer](https://rawgit.com/bgordon01/express-polymer/develop/polymerLogo.svg) | https://www.polymer-project.org | version 1.0.0

This setup is based on the following github repositories: 

1. https://github.com/lushfuture/polymer-express which is fairly outdated now and then

2. https://github.com/WesBlackmore/express-polymer which is a more recent one, but still outdated.

I also used this video tutorial on what needs to be done: Polymer + Express App: Episode 1: Scaffolding, it's quite old but shows the basic principles required.
